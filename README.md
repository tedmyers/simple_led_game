# simple_led_game
Holds code for a simple LED game I made. 

![Press the button!](https://github.com/tedmyers/simple_led_game/blob/master/led_game.jpg "Picture of the Game")

## How to Use
1. Build game on Arduino Protoboard Shield
2. Load Code onto Arduino Uno
3. Play Game!

## How to Play
You need to press the button while either of the two green LEDs are on to continue to the next level. If you press the button at the correct time, all LEDs will flash twice, and then move onto the next level with a harder difficulty. If you fail (press the button at the wrong time) it will start over, to the easiest difficulty available.
